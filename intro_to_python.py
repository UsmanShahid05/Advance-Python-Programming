""""
Intro to python. Python, very popular and most favorite lauguage that is build for developer to work fast, 
and resolve their problem easily. Let's begin our journey with python. We will inialize our journey with
Basic code and then we'll proceed to advance as we move on. """

""" The first code for the python developer is non other than printing Hello World!. Let's try this."""

print("Hello World!") # Explination => To print the output on screen we always use "print()" fucntion, function are basially particular line of code that perform predefined step of instructions.
# To print value in function, we use parenthesis " ( ) " and if the value is string ( "charactors") then we put these into quotation, either single or double.

# Let's write a simple code for basic calculation between two values.

# Assigning value to variable. At this time think variable as boxes that store certain things. We use '=' to assign value to variable.

first_value= 4 # Declaring first variable
second_value=8 # Declaring second variable.

# Calculating sum, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentional value of these two variables.

# Addition of values.
# Declaring third variable to store the value.
third_variable=first_value+second_value 
print(third_variable)
# We can add values even not using third variable let's try it.
print(first_value+second_value)


# Subtracting value.
subtration=first_value-second_value
print(subtration)

# Multiplication
multiplication=first_value*second_value # "estaric '*' is use for multiplication."
print(multiplication)

#Division
division=first_value/second_value # "forward slash '/' is used for division."
print(division)

#Exponentional operation.
power_factor=first_value ** second_value # "exponentional operator is represented as '*' and between the values and operator we can also put space."
print(power_factor)


# As all these calculation needs operators like plus, minus, estaric, division etc. All these operators are know as "Operators or Variable Operator."
# We will learn more about these in our comming lectures.
