        "I've just developed a handy Employee Salary Calculator using Python! This script helps users compute their monthly salary based on their hourly rate, the number of hours worked, and the total days in the month. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of how it works:\n",

        "üîç Features:\n",
        "User Input: The program prompts users to enter their name, hourly rate, hours worked, and the number of working days in the month.\n",
        "Input Validation: It robustly handles invalid inputs, ensuring that only valid numbers are accepted for calculations.\n",
        "Salary Calculation: The monthly salary is calculated using the formula:\n",
        "Total¬†Salary\n",

        "Total¬†Salary=Hourly¬†Rate√óWorked¬†Hours√óDays¬†in¬†Month\n",
        "Currency Conversion: The script converts the salary amount to Pakistani Rupees (PKR) at a conversion rate of 280 PKR per USD.\n",
        "Detailed Salary Report: All the relevant information is stored in a structured dictionary and printed out for easy reference.\n",
        "Retry Option: Users can choose to calculate the salary for another employee without restarting the program."
